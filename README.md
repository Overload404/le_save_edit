<h1> What is this </h1>

LE Save Edit is a simple Python App for Last Epoch that allows you to:
 <ul>
    <li> Change character level </li>
    <li> Skip story </li>
    <li> Change mastery </li>
    <li> Open waypoints </li>
    <li> Reset skillpoints </li>
 </ul>
 
 It's nothing fancy, and it doesn't allow you to add any items to your character or stash, which is by design.
 
 I didn't want to create anything to take out all the fun out of the game. Just something to skip past the story in the single player game if you've already seen it once, and get straight to the endgame content if you already have some starter gold and items.
